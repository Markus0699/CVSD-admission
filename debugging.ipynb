    "<p>\n",
    "    First off all, I got an shape ValueError, I commented everything after the 'for' loop and just looked at how the .csv file was generated. I noticed there is an empty row between every row of data. I adjusted my for loop to ignore every empty row by adding \"if len(row) == 2:\". After that I uncommented everything related to matplotlib.pyplot. I noticed that code related to matplotlib.pyplot made my kernel crash constantly. After some digging around I found out that when I import anything related to torch while I work with matplotlib.pyplot code, it makes my kernel crash. I'm not sure if this is intentional on your side, when testing this code I made sure that I dont execute the first cell full of imports, which made it possible for me to keep working in this Jupyter Notebook environment.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Now after introducing the needed imports at start of the cell, I could see a graph being plotted. The only problem left now is the fact that the graph isn't plotting the data in the right way. The graph shows a straight line, which isnt expected. I fixed this by changing \"results = np.stack(results)\" to \"results = np.array(results, dtype=float)\", after some trial and error.\n",

    "    First off all, I had some issues running this example, just like the previous exercise, executing anything from matplotlib and torch in one program crashes my kernel. \n",
    "    I imported this project into my own VSC environment and installed all needed packages. Now I could finally run the code, but is was very slow because it was running on my CPU. I really wanted to see the results of the program in order to get a better understanding of whats happening, but after an hour of waiting I was still at epoch 20/100... It should be running on CUDA since I have an Nvidia GPU, but is wasn't. It send me on a rabbit hole of debugging, but after a day of tinkering I managed to fix it, turns out I needed to install the CUDA toolkit and specific torch libraries to utilize CUDA. It takes me less than 40 minutes now to finish the same program! :-)\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    So, after that journey I could finally start with the exercise. It is quite obvious that the error has something to do with the batch_size, so I started looking there. By printing the size of all samples and labels (real, generated and output discriminator) I noticed that just before the crash real_samples has a size of 32 and real_sample_labels has a size of 64 (bound to batch_size). All the labels added up ended up being 128 (64 + 64), but all samples added up ended being 96 (32 + 64). This is where the error message comes from. I did some thinkering and ended up using .size() with all labels and samples. You can find the code below, it seems to be fixed now.\n",
